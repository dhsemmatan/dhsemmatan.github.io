<h2>About Me!</h2>
<h3>Hello! I am Emma Tan and I am 13 this year. I am a student at <a href="http://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Dunman High School</a> and is currently in Year 1. 
My CCA is Badminton and it adds to my interesting life in secondary school.</h3> 

<h2>Here are the things I like:<h2>

    <h3>So if I like to travel, where do I like to visit? I love England as the winter climate there is super shiok (versus the hot weather in Singapore. I like Penang and Langkawi in Malaysia as the food there is heavenly and there are just so many different types of water sports and the beach to choose from.</h3>
<li>Cooking (which shows that I like to eat)</li>
