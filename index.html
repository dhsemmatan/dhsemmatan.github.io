  <h1><em>Emma Tan's Self Introduction</em></h1>
  
<h1>About Me!</h1>
<h2>Hello! I am Emma Tan and I am 13 this year. I am a student at <a href="http://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Dunman High School</a> and is currently in Year 1. 
My CCA is Badminton and it adds to my interesting life in secondary school. I am friendly and I can basically make friends in half and hour. Although I am 13, I have a mental age of a toddler :) I love to annoy people and make them laugh. Laughing blesses my soul.</h2> 

<h1>Here are the things I like:</h1>
  <h2>
  <ul>
<li>Sports</li>

    <p>My CCA is badminton and I have been active in the sport since Primary 2. I love any sport and learn different skills on the way.</p>
<li>Travelling</li>

    <p>So if I like to travel, where do I like to visit? I love England as the winter climate there is super shiok (versus the hot weather in Singapore). I like Penang and Langkawi in Malaysia as the food there is heavenly and there are just so many different types of water sports and the beach to choose from.</p>
<li>Cooking</li>

    <p>I occasionally help out in the kitchen when my mom is cooking, and I enjoy putting ingredients together to form a dish. To me, cooking is art and I enjoy it very much! So if I like cooking, I love eating too! Somehow, I prefer homecooked meals much more than outside food.</p>
