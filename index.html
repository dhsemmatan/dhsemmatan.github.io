<h1>About Me!</h1>
<h2>Hello! I am Emma Tan and I am 13 this year. I am a student at <a href="http://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Dunman High School</a> and is currently in Year 1. 
My CCA is Badminton and it adds to my interesting life in secondary school.</h2> 

<h1>Here are the things I like:</h1>
<p>
  <ul>
<li>Sports</li>

<li>Travelling</li>

    <p>So if I like to travel, where do I like to visit? I love England as the winter climate there is super shiok (versus the hot weather in Singapore). I like Penang and Langkawi in Malaysia as the food there is heavenly and there are just so many different types of water sports and the beach to choose from.</p>
<li>Cooking (which shows that I like to eat)</li>
